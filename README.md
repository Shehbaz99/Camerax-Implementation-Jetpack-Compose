# 📸 CameraX Implementation with Jetpack Compose

A modern Android application built with **Kotlin**, **Jetpack Compose**, and **CameraX** that demonstrates camera preview, image capture, lifecycle-aware camera management, and modern Android UI development using a declarative approach.

This project was created as a learning-focused implementation to explore Google's recommended camera APIs and gain hands-on experience with modern Android development practices.

# 🎯 Core Functionalities

## Camera Preview

The application uses CameraX Preview API to display a real-time camera feed while maintaining compatibility across Android devices.

Features include:

* Live camera stream
* Lifecycle-aware binding
* Optimized camera initialization

---

## Image Capture

Users can capture photos directly from the application using CameraX ImageCapture.

Capabilities include:

* High-quality image capture
* Storage integration
* Capture callbacks
* Error handling

---

## Camera Selection

Allows switching between:

* Front Camera
* Back Camera

using CameraSelector APIs.

# 🧠 What I Learned

This project was built primarily to gain hands-on experience with:

* Jetpack Compose
* CameraX APIs
* Android Lifecycle Management
* State Management in Compose
* Camera Resource Handling
* Modern Android Architecture
* Declarative UI Development
* Coroutines
* Runtime Permissions

# 🔥 Technical Challenges

## Camera Lifecycle Management

One of the biggest challenges was ensuring camera resources were properly bound and released according to the Activity/Composable lifecycle.

### Solution

Used CameraX lifecycle-aware APIs to automatically manage camera resources and prevent leaks.

---

## Compose + CameraX Integration

Integrating a traditional Android View-based camera preview inside a Compose application required interoperability between Compose and Android Views.

### Solution

Used AndroidView to host PreviewView while keeping the rest of the UI fully Compose-based.

---

## Runtime Permissions

Managing camera permissions gracefully while maintaining a smooth user experience required handling multiple permission states.

### Solution

Implemented permission checks before camera initialization and provided fallback UI when permissions were denied.
